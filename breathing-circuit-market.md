<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Breathing Circuit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open</li><li>Semi-Open</li><li>Closed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Breathing circuits are crucial in medical settings for respiratory support. In an open circuit, exhaled gases are expelled into the environment, minimizing rebreathing but potentially compromising gas quality. Semi-open circuits allow some rebreathing, using minimal additional fresh gas, striking a balance between efficiency and gas management. Closed circuits, on the other hand, recycle exhaled gases entirely within a system, maintaining consistent gas concentrations and minimizing waste, making them ideal for controlled environments like anesthesia during surgery.</p></p>
